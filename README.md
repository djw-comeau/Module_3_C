Exercise Instructions for Module 3

You are tasked with completing a program using the topics covered in Module 3. Follow these exact requirements to ensure your submission is complete.
1. Program Requirements

You must write a program in C that performs the following tasks:
Floating-Point Values:

    Declare two float variables and assign them real numbers.

    Calculate the sum, difference, multiplication, and division of these numbers.

    Print the results, formatted to display two decimal places.

Arithmetic Operators:

    Use the modulus operator to find the remainder of a division involving two integers.

    Print the result.

Character Data Type (char):

    Declare a char variable and assign it a letter (e.g., 'A').

    Print the character and its ASCII value using %c and %d.

Input and Output with printf() and scanf():

    Prompt the user to input an integer and a float.

    Print the values entered by the user.

Increment/Decrement Operations:

    Declare an integer variable and demonstrate the use of pre- and post-increment operators.

    Print the value of the variable before and after each operation.

2. Output Formatting:

    Use printf() to display results with clear and organized formatting.

    Include descriptions for each output (e.g., "The sum is: ...").

3. Comments:

    Add comments to explain the purpose of the program and the functionality of each section of the code.

Video Demonstration
Record Your Screen:

    Open your IDE or terminal with the completed program.

    Run the program and explain the output step-by-step:

        Show floating-point operations results.

        Display the modulus result.

        Demonstrate the char and ASCII value.

        Show the input/output of user-entered values.

        Explain the increment/decrement operations.

Save the Video:

    Save the screen recording.

Upload the Video:

    Upload the video to a file-sharing platform (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, or YouTube as unlisted).

    Copy the shareable link.

Final Submission

Ensure the following are complete:

    Code Submission:

        Your code is pushed to the repository.

        The file is named and placed in the correct directory.

    Video Submission:

        The video is uploaded, and the link is accessible.

    Submission:

        Submit both the repository link and the video link in the Brightspace submission box.
